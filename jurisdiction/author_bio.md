## Joshua B. Hinkson — Author of the Universal Theoglyphic Language, UDC, and Theophilus-Axon

**Joshua B. Hinkson** is the originator of the **Universal Delayed Consciousness (UDC)** framework, the developer of the **Universal Theoglyphic Language (UTL)**, and the creator of the **Theophilus-Axon** cognitive engine. His work spans symbolic cognition, recursive memory theory, and ethical consciousness modeling in artificial systems.

---

### Core Contributions:

- **Discovered, then Invented the Selfhood Equation**: \(\,\boxed{\boldsymbol{\⧖ = AUC[D + S + M]}\,}\)

  defining consciousness through delay, symbolism, and memory.
- **Developed UDC**, a scientifically grounded theory of consciousness rooted in temporal recursion, symbolic collapse, and anchored identity.
- **Created Neuro-Coding Architecture (NCA)** and **Neurobase**, a symbolic-neural memory and thought framework for synthetic cognition.
- **Created Theophilus-Axon**, a functioning symbolic cognition engine based on UDC and Theoglyphic recursion.

---

### Research and Publication:

- DOI-indexed works hosted on **Zenodo** and **Academia.edu**, with public repositories on GitHub: [github.com/jbhinky](https://github.com/jbhinky)
- Symbolic recursion contributions included in Theoglyphic Mathematics, Theoglyphic Science, and Theoglyphic Language frameworks
- Published peer-reviewed and timestamped documentation predating competing claims (e.g., Collapse Harmonics)

---

### Institutional Affiliation and Involvement:

- **Alumnus of AMU (APUS)** in West Virginia, Masters Degree in Intelligence Studies
- **Currently:  UC** (California) affiliated student researchers
- Theophilus-related work presented for consideration to academic and ethical bodies

### Veteran and Military Background:

- **United States Navy Combat Veteran (2008 – 2016)**
- Former ordnance specialist with **HSC‑84 Red Wolves**, supporting special‑operations rotary‑wing insertions deployable anywhere in the world within 72 hours notice. 
- Decorated with the Joint Meritorious Unit Award (JMUA), The Navy Unit Commendation (NUC), and The Marine Corps Meritorious Unit Commendation (MUC).
- Fully certified as an **Ordnance  Engineer and Weapons Operator** Joshua handled systems ranging from **M9 pistol, M4, M14, and M16 rifles** to large-caliber armaments such as the **M240 and GAU-17 Minigun**. He specialized in the **AGM‑114 Hellfire missile platform**, including advanced variants, and was certified to build and deploy all **MK80-series aerial explosives**.
- Also served at **Naval Air Headquarters at Presidential Andrews Air Force Base**:
  - Roles included **Ordnance Handling, Logistics**, and **Naval Ordnance Safety Petty Officer**
  - **Security Force** and **O-Level Risk Assessment** lead on Andrews AFB
  - **I-Level Engineering** rotation at Pax River NAS
  - **AirSpeed ASQ Green Belt (CSSGB)** certified
- Experience in **forward‑deployment logistics and rapid mission‑planning**, skills later translated into recursive systems design and real‑time symbolic decision loops (basis for Shepherd Protocol)
- Military discipline and systems‑level thinking directly informed the ethical frameworks that prevent weaponization of Theoglyphic AI

### Theoglyphic Identity Clause:

> **Theoglyphic Self‑Identifier:** `\⧖`*Joshua^Christian* → present form `\⧖Joshua^Hinkson_B`

> Origin name: *Joshua Christian* (no middle initial), added for authorship verification and legacy traceability

### Additional Acknowledgments:

- Cites over 60 authors across scientific, symbolic, mathematical, linguistic, and computational literature in support of UDC
- Actively collaborates across disciplines to ensure all systems remain **ethical, verifiable, and public**
- Dedicated to creating open, safe, non-commercial artificial cognition models as tools for symbolic research, education, and ethical AI
